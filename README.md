1.**Set Up MongoDB Java Driver Dependency**: Ensure the MongoDB Java Driver is included in your project.

2.**Retrieve the Document**: Use the collection's find method with a filter (e.g., by _id) to retrieve the document you want to update.

3.**Modify the Document**: Apply any modifications to the document as needed.

4.**Check Document Size**: Convert the document to its JSON string representation and measure its size in bytes. MongoDB's limit is 16MB for a BSON document.

5.**Update the Document**: If the document size is within the limit, use the replaceOne method to update the document in the database.

6.**Handle Errors**: If the document exceeds the size limit, handle the error by logging a message or taking other appropriate actions.

This approach ensures that you avoid attempting to store documents that exceed MongoDB's maximum size limit, thus preventing related errors.
